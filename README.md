# Semiconductor_Circuits
This repository contains my lab files for Semiconductor circuits. The files include circuit diagrams, schematics, and simulation results that were created as part of my coursework.

Each lab file corresponds to a specific Semiconductor circuit, and includes a brief description of the circuit's function, design, and analysis. The files are organized by lab session and cover a range of topics, including diodes, transistors, and operational amplifiers.

Overall, these lab files provide a comprehensive introduction to Semiconductor circuits and demonstrate their use in practical applications. They are suitable for students and hobbyists interested in analog electronics and circuit design.
